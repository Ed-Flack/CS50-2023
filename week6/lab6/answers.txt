Questions:

Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?:
I initially thought Brazil had the highest chance, but as I increased the number of simulations, Belgium had the highest chance

Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?:
1000 because the results do not change much after that
